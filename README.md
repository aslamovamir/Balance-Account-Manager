# Balance-Account-Manager
This program is written to simulate the checking account manager in a dashboard form. The program shows the GUI in the form of Windows Forms and switches                        between several forms depending on what the user selects to do in the main form - Dashboard Form: either Deposit Money, Withdraw Money, or Check His/Her Balance.                        The program validates each input at every point of the program and makes sure the transaction requests can be successfully completed. The program uses                        MessageBox class to show the corresponding messages to the user at each step of the processes.
